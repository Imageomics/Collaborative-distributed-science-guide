## About the Guide

This guide was created from our Institute internal-guidelines wiki, which was primarily focused on providing guidance and best practices for collaborative and interdisciplinary (computer science + biology) work. We moved the vast majority of the guidelines to this [guide](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/), since the topics and suggestions are broadly applicable to anyone working in similar or adjacent fields. To increase accessibility for those less familiar with GitHub, we generated the [site](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/) from our Markdown wiki documents with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Imageomics/Imageomics-guide/issues) with any questions regarding the content fo this guide or if you would like to contribute to the [Glossary](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/wiki-guide/Glossary-for-Imageomics/) or [Helpful Tools page](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/wiki-guide/Helpful-Tools-for-your-Workflow/).
